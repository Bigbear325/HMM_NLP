1. concatenation
When testing concatenation, make sure /data/p2/concatedated.txt is the 36MB file.
2. Non-concatenation
When testing concatenation, please rename /data/p2/concatedated2.txt with file name concatedated.txt.

3. Run
a. Run ./build_java.sh
b. Make sure the parameter of the mu in run_java.sh. the result is made by two subtest in order to prevent memory crash. first test from mu 0.0- 0.5; second test from mu 0.6-1.0. so please make sure the mu parameter is correct.
c. Run ./run_java.sh

Thinking for improvement:
first of all, it's really hard experiment but I learn alot. From the beginning, my accuracy is only 0.1 due to the wrong parameter, that it improve to 50% -60% until project 2 phase 1. Finally, I can make to 80%-90%.
I'm thinking about to use map-reduce to improve the overall performance. But I have no time to do the experiment. I will keep doing it later. 

Thank you,

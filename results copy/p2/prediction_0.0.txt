The PRP$

the CC

In WRB

Gradually RB

Essentially RB
, ,
Mr. CC

had CC
invested DT
heavily ,
in CC
the ,

he ,
was CC

Bernard CC
`` ,

that CC
the ,

After WRB
placing DT

, CC
Mr. NNP

called CC
Martin NNP

, CC
an ,
investment CC

at CC
Kidder NNP

Co. CC
, ,
who CC
was ,
advising CC

the CC

confirm CC
these NNP

Mr. NNP

asked CC
Mr. NNP

who CC
his ,
source CC
was ,
and CC
, ,
on CC
hearing NNP
that ,
it CC

Bunny CC
Lasker NNP
, ,
responded CC
: ,
`` CC
Well NNP

'' NN

The PRP$
illegal JJ
`` ,

'' ,
of CC
the IN
bunny ,

good ,

was ,
then CC
largely ,
a CC
confirmation ,

rumors IN
already ,
known CC
to ,
many CC

the CC

Had (
the CC

gone CC

the ,

surfaced DT

Was RB
there ,
a CC
fiduciary ,
breach CC
in ,
order CC
to ,
obtain CC
personal ,
gain CC
? NN

Did WP$
Mr. NNP
Freeman ,
have CC
notice ,
of CC
this ,
? NN

Finally RB
, ,
was CC
the ,
information CC
material ,
? NN

Yet RB
, ,
all CC
these ,
issues CC
are ,
subsidiary CC
to ,
a CC
more ,
central CC
issue ,
: CC
Who NNP
is ,
and CC
who NNP
should ,
be CC
making ,
the CC
criminal ,
law CC
here ,
? NN

It EX
is VBZ
not ,
my CC
contention ,
that CC
either ,
Mr. CC
Chestman ,
or CC
Mr. NNP
Freeman ,
was CC
an ,
innocent CC
victim ,
of CC
prosecutorial DT
overzealousness IN
. NN

Arguably RB
, ,
both CC
were ,
on CC
notice NNP
that ,
their CC
behavior ,
was CC
at ,
least CC
risky DT
. NN

But RB
even ,
if CC
they ,
behaved CC
recklessly ,
, CC
reasons ,
still CC
exist ,
to CC
fear ,
and CC
resist ,
this CC
steady ,
process CC
of ,
case-by-case CC
judicial ,
extension CC
of ,
the CC
law ,
of CC
insider ,
trading CC
. NN

Courts (
and CC
legislatures ,
make CC
decisions ,
in CC
very ,
different CC
ways ,
and CC
are ,
each CC
susceptible ,
to CC
very ,
different CC
kinds ,
of CC
errors DT
. NN

After-the-fact RB
judicial ,
examination CC
of ,
an CC
actor ,
's CC
conduct ,
has CC
always ,
been CC
the ,
common CC
law ,
's CC
method ,
. NN

When RB
only ,
civil CC
liability DT
is ,
involved CC
, ,
this CC
method ,
has CC
the ,
undeniable CC
strengths ,
of CC
factual DT
specificity ,
and CC
avoidance ,
of CC
overgeneralization DT
. NN

Still RB
, ,
case-by-case CC
retrospective NNP
decision ,
making CC
of ,
this CC
sort ,
is CC
vulnerable NNP
to ,
the CC
tunnel NNP
vision ,
caused CC
by ,
a CC
fixation ,
on CC
ad ,
hoc CC
-LRB- ,
and CC
usually ,
sleazy CC
-RRB- ,
examples DT
. NN

When RB
a ,
court CC
decides ,
that CC
a ,
particular DT
actor ,
's CC
conduct ,
was CC
culpable ,
and CC
so ,
extends CC
the ,
definition CC
of ,
insider CC
trading ,
to CC
reach ,
this CC
conduct ,
, CC
it ,
does CC
not ,
see CC
the IN
potentially ,
enormous CC
number ,
of CC
other ,
cases CC
that ,
will MD
be VB
covered DT
by ,
the CC
expanded ,
rule DT
. NN

Thus RB
, ,
a CC
court DT
is ,
poorly CC
positioned ,
to CC
make ,
judgments CC
about IN
the ,
social CC
utility ,
of CC
the ,
expanded CC
rule ,
. NN

For RB
example ,
, CC
in ,
focusing CC
on ,
Mr. CC
Freeman ,
's CC
attempt ,
to CC
gain ,
nonpublic CC
information ,
about CC
a ,
deal CC
's ,
collapse DT
, ,
one CC
does ,
not CC
naturally NNP
think ,
about CC
the ,
reverse CC
side ,
of CC
the ,
coin CC
: ,
What CC
if ,
the CC
rumor ,
had CC
been ,
false DT
? NN

Can RB
a ,
security CC
analyst ,
call CC
an ,
investment CC
banker ,
to CC
make ,
certain CC
that IN
a ,
seemingly CC
improbable NNP
rumor ,
is CC
in ,
fact CC
false DT
? NN

In NNP
the ,
past CC
, ,
not CC
only ,
would MD
reputable VB
professionals IN
have ,
rushed CC
to ,
check CC
out ,
such CC
rumors IN
with ,
the CC
company ,
, CC
but ,
companies CC
listed ,
on CC
the ,
major CC
stock ,
exchanges CC
were ,
encouraged CC
by ,
the CC
exchanges ,
to CC
respond PRP$
openly JJ
to ,
such CC
inquiries ,
from CC
securities ,
analysts CC
. NN

Today RB
, ,
after CC
Mr. NNP
Freeman ,
's CC
plea NNP
, ,
there CC
is ,
an CC
uncertainty ,
that CC
is ,
both CC
unfair ,
and CC
inefficient DT
. NN

In (
this CC
light ,
, CC
the ,
comparative NNP
advantages ,
of CC
legislative ,
law-making CC
become ,
clear CC
: ,
-LRB- TO
1 $
-RRB- CD
Before ,
it CC
acts NNP
, ,
the CC
legislature ,
typically WDT
will MD
hear ,
the CC
views ,
of CC
representatives ,
of CC
all ,
those CC
affected ,
by CC
its ,
decision CC
, ,
not CC
just ,
the CC
immediate ,
parties IN
before ,
the CC
court ,
; CC
and ,
-LRB- TO
2 $
-RRB- CD
the ,
legislature CC
can ,
frame CC
`` ,
bright CC
line ,
'' CC
standards NNP
that ,
create CC
less ,
uncertainty CC
than ,
the CC
fact-bound NNP
decisions ,
of CC
courts DT
. NN

Although RB
legislative ,
lines CC
can ,
result CC
in ,
under-inclusion DT
-LRB- ,
which CC
explains ,
why CC
the ,
SEC CC
has ,
long CC
resisted ,
a CC
legislative ,
definition CC
of ,
insider CC
trading ,
-RRB- CC
, ,
judicial CC
lawmaking ,
inevitably CC
creates DT
uncertainty ,
because CC
of ,
the CC
shadowy ,
outer CC
edges ,
and CC
implications ,
of CC
most ,
judicial CC
decisions ,
. NN

At RB
least ,
when CC
the ,
stakes CC
are ,
high CC
, ,
uncertainty CC
in ,
turn CC
results ,
in CC
overinclusion NNP
, ,
as CC
individuals NNP
do ,
not CC
dare ,
to CC
approach ,
an CC
uncertain ,
line CC
closely ,
. NN

The PRP$
federal JJ
mail ,
and CC
wire DT
fraud ,
statutes CC
provide ,
even CC
better DT
illustrations ,
of CC
the ,
rapid CC
evolution ,
of CC
a ,
federal CC
common ,
law CC
of ,
white-collar DT
crime ,
. NN

In WRB
1987 NNP
, ,
the CC
Supreme ,
Court CC
attempted ,
in CC
McNally ,
v. CC
U.S. NNP
to ,
halt CC
the ,
inexorable CC
expansion ,
of CC
these ,
statutes CC
by ,
adopting CC
a ,
rule CC
of ,
strict DT
construction ,
for CC
ambiguous ,
criminal CC
statues DT
. NN

Yet RB
, ,
late CC
last ,
year CC
, ,
Congress CC
effectively ,
reversed CC
this ,
decision CC
by ,
enacting DT
a ,
one-sentence CC
statute ,
that CC
defined DT
fraud ,
to CC
include ,
any CC
scheme ,
to CC
deprive ,
another IN
of ,
`` CC
the ,
intangible CC
right ,
of CC
honest DT
services ,
. DT
'' NN

At RB
a ,
stroke NNP
, ,
this CC
may ,
criminalize CC
all DT
fiduciary ,
breaches CC
-LRB- ,
and CC
possibly ,
all CC
misrepresentations ,
by CC
an ,
agent CC
or ,
employee CC
-RRB- ,
. NN

Such (
a CC
statute ,
illustrates CC
the ,
fundamental CC
problem ,
: CC
Congress ,
finds CC
it ,
is CC
easier NNP
to ,
pass CC
sweepingly ,
moralistic CC
prohibitions NNP
, ,
which CC
the ,
courts DT
must ,
thereafter CC
interpret NNP
, ,
than CC
to ,
engage CC
in ,
the CC
difficult ,
line-drawing CC
distinctions ,
that CC
are ,
inherently CC
its ,
responsibility DT

We PRP

confronted IN
less ,

Predictably RB

dubious JJ

The PRP$
IMF JJ

several CC
reasons ,

Its PRP$
role JJ

the CC
economies ,

countries IN
has ,
grown CC
steadily ,
since CC
the ,
1970s DT

The PRP$
size JJ

At RB
least ,
three CC
other ,
factors IN
have ,
encouraged CC
the ,
IMF CC
to ,
insist CC

increased CC
capital ,
. NN

First NNP
, ,
it CC
argues ,
that CC
its ,
capital CC
base ,
must CC
be ,
increased CC
in ,

to ,
maintain CC
its ,
size CC
relative ,
to CC
world ,
financial CC

it ,

some ,

left CC

less CC

financial CC

Third NNP
, ,
the CC
IMF NNP
would ,
like CC
to ,
meet CC
Japan NNP
's ,
request CC
for ,
increased CC
ownership ,
-LRB- CC
currently ,
4.5 CC
% ,
-RRB- DT
. NN

Japan NNP
has ,
supported CC
a ,
larger CC
role ,
for CC
the ,
IMF CC

developing-country CC

issues CC
, ,
and CC
is ,
an CC
important ,
financial CC
resource ,

IMF-guided DT
programs ,

countries DT

While (
international CC

the ,
capital CC
increase ,
, CC
there ,

a ,
clear CC
economic ,
case CC

Opponents (
of CC
the ,
increase CC
argue ,
that CC
the ,
IMF CC
practices ,
central CC
planning ,

supporting ,
ineffective CC
governments ,

They RB
question ,
whether CC
the ,
IMF CC
has ,
any CC
role ,

developing ,
countries IN
, ,
given CC
its ,
original CC
mandate ,
to CC
assist ,
industrial CC
countries ,
in CC
balance-of-payments DT
emergencies IN

Opponents RB
show ,
that CC
there ,
are CC
already ,
more CC

available CC

commendable CC
reform ,
efforts DT

They (
worry CC
that ,
new CC
IMF ,
funding CC

simply ,
end CC
up ,
substituting CC
IMF ,
debt CC
for ,
reschedulable CC
commercial ,
bank CC
debt ,
, CC
a ,
bad CC
trade ,
all CC
around ,

They PRP

microeconomics RB
, ,
which CC
addresses ,
the CC
problems ,
of CC

climate ,

the ,
key CC

the ,
IMF CC

Keynesian CC
focus ,

They RB
point ,
at CC
the ,
numerous CC
developing-country NNP
governments ,
that CC
have ,
inflated CC
, ,
taxed CC
and ,
regulated CC
themselves ,
into CC
despair DT
under ,
successive CC
IMF ,
programs CC
. NN

Decisions (
on CC
increases ,
in CC
the ,
IMF CC

capital CC
base DT
traditionally ,
are CC
made ,
by CC
the ,
administration CC
, ,

subsequent DT
authorization ,

Congress ,

The NNP
last ,
U.S. CC

The NNP

likely CC
to ,
be CC
similar ,

those ,

U.S. DT

the DT

For ``

although CC

In ``

Consider ``

Prior VBG

Mr. NNP

A ``

Robert DT

Essentially NNP

Mr. DT

heavily VBN

the DT

when CC

After ``

Mr. NNP

Mr. NNP

on DT

Lasker RB

`` ``

The ``

was VBD
then RB
largely ,
a DT
confirmation NN

Had ``

Did ``

Finally NNP

Yet RB

all DT

central WP$
issue NN
: :
Who EX

It EX

not VB
my DT
contention NN
that IN
either DT
Mr. NNP
Chestman ,

Mr. DT

was CC
an DT
innocent JJ
victim NN

overzealousness JJ

Arguably NNP

both DT

But ``
even DT

reasons WDT

this DT

very DT

each CD
susceptible VBN

very VB
different DT
kinds NN
of IN
errors DT

After-the-fact ``
judicial DT
examination NN
of IN
an DT
actor NN

conduct NN
has VBZ
always RB
been VB
the DT
common JJ

method NN

When ``
only DT

, ,
this DT
method NN
has CC
the DT
undeniable NN

Still NNP

the DT

When ``

so DT
extends ``
the DT

potentially NN
enormous WP$

that WDT

Thus NNP

is VBZ
poorly RB

social JJ

For ``

In ``

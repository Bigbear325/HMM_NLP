It EX

U.S. DT

the DT

For ``

although CC

In ``

A ``

Essentially NNP

Mr. NNP

had CC

heavily VBN

the VB

when CC

After ``

Mr. NNP

Mr. NNP

on CC

Lasker RB

`` ``

The ``

largely VB
a DT

Did ``
Mr. NNP

Finally RB

Yet RB

all CC

central WP$
issue NN

Who NNP

It EX

my DT
contention NN

either DT
Mr. NNP

Mr. NNP

an DT
innocent JJ

Arguably NNP

both DT

But ``
even DT

reasons WDT

After-the-fact ``
judicial DT
examination NN

always RB

the DT
common JJ

When ``

this CC
method DT

the DT

Still RB

vulnerable VBN

the DT

When ``

enormous WP$

Thus RB

The DT

We EX
've VBZ
actually RB
read VB
the DT
speech NN
. NN

Mr. DT
Allen NN
began ,
it NN
with IN
a DT
warning NN
to TO
his DT
hosts NN
, ,
a DT
California JJ
church NN
group NN
that IN
opposes DT
rights NNS
for IN
homosexuals DT
. NN

He EX
said VBZ
that IN
other DT
participants NN
in IN
the DT
conference NN
`` ``
do VB
not DT
believe NN
that IN
the DT
rights NNS
of IN
Americans PRP
should MD
be VB
guaranteed VBN
to TO

homosexual RB
, ,
'' DT
but NN
that IN
`` ``
I DT
mean NN
to TO

you PRP
to MD
the VB
opposite DT
view NN

'' NN

He EX
recalled VBZ
to TO
the DT
audience NN
a DT
`` ``
strange DT
, ,
infelicitous DT
'' NN
analogy NN
he NN
once VBZ
heard VBN
arguing TO
`` VB
now DT
that NN
we MD
have VB
finally DT
recognized NN
that IN
American DT
blacks NNS

, ,

need NN
to TO
do VB
the DT

for IN

. NN

'' ``
Mr. DT
Allen NN
objected VBG
to TO
this DT
analogy NN
because IN
it PRP
seems VBZ
to TO
`` VB
assimilate IN
the DT
status NN
of IN
blacks VBG
to TO
that IN
of IN

-- NN
as IN
a DT
mere JJ

'' NN

Rights DT
on IN
such IN
a DT
basis NN
, ,
whether IN
for DT
blacks NNS

homosexuals DT
, ,
are DT
`` ``
mere DT
indulgences NN
, ,
'' DT
he NN
said VBD
, ,
subject VBG
to TO
being VB
taken DT
back NN
. NN

He EX
says VBZ
the DT
title NN
of IN
his DT
speech NN
was VBZ
to TO
make VB
his DT
point NN
that IN
Americans DT
have NN
rights NNS
as IN
individuals NN
, ,
not DT
as IN
members NNS
of IN
certain DT
select JJ
groups NN
. NN

His ``
speech NN
criticized ,
the DT
`` ``
idiocy DT
of IN
notions RBS
of IN
protected DT
groups NN
in IN
society DT
'' NN
as IN
opposed VBG
to TO
individual $
equality CD
or NN
, ,
as DT
he NN
put NN
it NN
, ,
in IN
`` ``
a DT
common JJ
destiny NN
as IN
Americans DT
. .
'' NN

Instead NNP
of IN
lobbying RBS
for IN
special DT
treatment NN
, ,
Mr. DT
Allen NN
said VBD
that IN
homosexuals CD
and CC
others DT
should MD
try VB
to TO
ensure VB
equal DT
treatment NN
under IN
the DT
law NN
and CC
not DT
aim NN
for IN
special DT
privileges NN
that IN
would DT
risk NN
`` ``
invidious DT
retrenchment NN

complicity NNS

This EX
hardly VBZ
sounds VBN
like IN
an DT
anti-homosexual NN
screed NNS

What EX

really RB
going VBN
on IN
here DT
? NN

The DT
three NN
most NN
important JJ
things NN
to TO
understand VB
about IN
Mr. DT
Allen NN
is VBZ
that DT
he NN
is VBZ
a DT
black JJ
conservative JJ
intellectual NN
-- IN
a DT
triple JJ
threat NN
to TO
the DT
liberal JJ
establishment NNS
. NN

Mr. DT
Allen NN
, ,
who DT
teaches JJ
government NN
at IN
prestigious DT
Harvey NN
Mudd WP$
College NN
in IN
California NNP
and CC
will MD
remain VB
a DT
member NN
of IN
the DT
commission NN
, ,
has VBZ
spent DT
years NN
arguing IN
that DT
civil JJ
rights NNS
are VBP
individuals DT
' JJ
rights NN
. NN

He EX
last VBZ
made VBN
waves IN
when DT
he NN
dared WDT
to MD
defend VB
an DT
Indian JJ
girl NN
who WP
had MD
been VB
adopted NN
by IN
non-Indian DT
parents NN
off IN
her DT

. NN

Mr. DT
Allen NN
quickly ,
ran DT
up NN
against IN
the DT
liberal JJ
establishment NNS
again RB
, ,
which WDT
somehow MD
elevated VB
the DT
vague JJ
concept NN
of IN
`` ``
Indian DT

'' NN
above IN
the DT
rights NNS
of IN
individual DT

There EX

Indeed NNP
, ,
the DT
gap NN
is VBZ
so DT
large NN
that IN
Mr. DT
Allen NN
's POS
critics NN
refuse VBG
to TO
engage VB
the DT
debate NN

Their DT
ridicule NN

him DT
is VBZ
no DT

Their DT
effort NN

out NN

A DT

Mr. DT

all DT

It EX

Arguably NNP

But ``

After-the-fact ``

When ``

this DT

the DT

Still NNP

When ``

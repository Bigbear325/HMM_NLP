The PRP$
three ``

Mr. ``

quickly MD

the VB

Mr. VB

A ``

supplied MD
by VB
the PRP
recent MD

entered MD

Robert PRP
Freeman MD

formerly PRP
head MD
of PRP
arbitrage MD
at VB
Goldman PRP

Essentially PRP
, MD
Mr. VB
Freeman PRP
had MD
invested VB
heavily PRP
in MD
the VB
Beatrice ``

when MD

was PRP

by VB
another PRP$

`` PRP

that VB
the PRP$

After PRP$
placing ``

Mr. MD
Freeman PRP
called MD
Martin VB
Siegel PRP

an VB

at VB
Kidder PRP

Peabody VB

, VB
who PRP
was MD
advising PRP

the VB

to PRP
confirm MD
these VB

Mr. ``
Siegel PRP
asked MD
Mr. VB

who MD
his VB

was MD

, PRP
on MD
hearing VB
that PRP
it MD

Bunny PRP$
Lasker PRP
, MD
responded VB
: PRP$
`` ``
Well PRP

your VB

'' NN

The ``
illegal PRP
`` MD
tip VB
'' PRP
of MD
the VB
bunny PRP

was MD
then VB
largely PRP
a MD
confirmation VB
of PRP$
rumors ``
already PRP
known MD

many PRP
in MD
the VB

Had ``
the PRP
case MD
gone VB

the VB

Was ``
there PRP
a MD

personal PRP$

Did ``
Mr. PRP

have PRP
notice MD

this PRP$

Finally PRP
, MD
was PRP
the MD
information VB
material PRP$
? NN

Yet PRP
, MD
all VB
these PRP
issues MD
are VB
subsidiary ``
to PRP
a MD
more VB
central PRP$
issue ``
: PRP
Who MD
is VB
and PRP
who MD
should VB
be PRP$
making ``
the PRP
criminal MD
law VB
here PRP$
? NN

It PRP
is MD
not VB
my PRP
contention MD
that VB
either PRP$
Mr. ``
Chestman PRP
or MD
Mr. VB
Freeman PRP
was MD
an VB
innocent PRP
victim MD
of VB
prosecutorial PRP$
overzealousness $
. NN

Arguably PRP$
, PRP
both MD
were VB
on PRP
notice MD
that VB
their PRP
behavior MD
was VB
at PRP

risky VB

But ``
even PRP
if MD
they VB
behaved PRP
recklessly MD
, VB
reasons PRP$
still PRP
exist MD
to VB
fear PRP

resist VB
this PRP$
steady ``
process PRP
of MD
case-by-case VB
judicial PRP
extension MD
of VB
the PRP
law MD
of VB
insider PRP$

Courts PRP

legislatures VB
make PRP$
decisions ``
in PRP
very MD
different VB
ways PRP

are VB
each PRP$
susceptible PRP
to MD
very VB
different PRP
kinds MD
of VB
errors PRP$
. NN

After-the-fact PRP$
judicial ``
examination PRP
of MD
an VB
actor PRP
's MD
conduct VB
has PRP
always MD
been VB
the PRP$
common PRP
law MD
's VB
method PRP$

When PRP
only MD
civil VB
liability PRP
is MD
involved PRP
, MD
this VB
method PRP
has MD
the VB
undeniable PRP
strengths MD
of VB
factual PRP
specificity MD
and VB
avoidance PRP
of MD
overgeneralization VB
. NN

Still MD
, VB
case-by-case PRP$
retrospective ``
decision PRP
making MD
of VB
this PRP
sort MD
is PRP
vulnerable MD
to VB
the PRP$
tunnel ``
vision PRP
caused MD
by VB
a PRP$
fixation PRP
on MD
ad PRP
hoc MD
-LRB- PRP
and MD
usually VB
sleazy PRP
-RRB- MD
examples VB
. NN

When WRB
a PRP
court MD
decides VB
that PRP
a MD
particular VB
actor PRP

conduct VB
was PRP
culpable MD
and VB
so PRP
extends MD
the VB
definition PRP
of MD
insider VB
trading PRP
to MD
reach VB
this PRP
conduct MD
, VB
it PRP
does MD
not PRP
see MD
the VB
potentially PRP$
enormous ``
number PRP
of MD
other VB
cases PRP
that MD
will VB
be PRP$
covered ``
by PRP
the MD
expanded VB
rule PRP$

Thus PRP
, MD
a VB
court PRP
is MD
poorly VB
positioned PRP
to MD
make VB
judgments PRP
about MD
the VB
social PRP$
utility ``
of PRP
the MD
expanded VB
rule PRP$

For PRP$

banker MD
to VB
make PRP
certain MD
that VB

In PRP$
the ``

out MD
such VB

such VB
inquiries PRP

Today ``

after MD
Mr. VB
Freeman PRP

there VB
is PRP
an MD
uncertainty VB
that PRP

both VB

In ``

the PRP$

: PRP
-LRB- MD

Before MD

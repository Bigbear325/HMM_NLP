His PRP$

The PRP$
three NN
most JJ

Mr. NNP

Harvey NNP

He EX

been VB
adopted VBN

Mr. NN
Allen IN
quickly NN
ran MD
up VB

which WDT
somehow MD
elevated VB
the DT

Indeed UH

the DT

is VBZ
so RB
large JJ
that IN
Mr. NNP
Allen NNP

For IN

although IN

it WDT

In IN

Consider ``

Prior VBG

Basically UH

Mr. NNP

The PRP$

A NN

Essentially UH

Mr. NNP

Mr. NNP

The PRP$

largely RB
a DT

Had ``

Did ``

Finally UH

Yet UH

all DT
these JJ

a VB
more DT
central JJ
issue NN
: DT
Who NN

It EX

my PRP$

Arguably UH

both MD

But ``
even DT

reasons NN
still MD

this DT

very VB
different DT

After-the-fact ``
judicial DT
examination NN
of IN
an DT

has DT
always MD
been VB
the DT
common JJ

When ``

this DT
method NN
has MD
the VB
undeniable DT

Still UH

case-by-case PRP$
retrospective NN
decision NN

this DT

is VBZ
vulnerable VBG
to TO
the DT
tunnel NN

When ``

that VB

so DT
extends VBG
the DT

it WDT

potentially JJ
enormous JJ

that WDT

Thus UH

poorly RB

For IN

Can ``

In IN

Today UH

In IN

In IN

Meanwhile NNP

the DT

increasingly DT
successful NN
at IN

In IN

This DT

In IN

for IN

the DT

At IN

Kandahar EX

The DT

such JJ

Experienced DT

Instead NN

they PRP

journalists DT
report NN
that IN

The DT
wonder NN
is VBZ
not RB
that IN
the DT
resistance NN
has VBZ
failed VBN
to TO

the DT
Kabul JJ

that DT
it NN

Last DT

in IN

the DT
State NN

said VBD
they PRP

months NNS

it PRP

how DT

For IN

the DT

has VBZ
been DT
defenseless NN

Thus NN
far NN
there WP

no DT
indication NN
that IN

re-supplied NN

Indeed NNP

U.S. NN

have VBP
indicated VBN

the DT

that IN
the DT

what DT

the DT

by IN
the DT

Moscow NNP

For IN
a DT

U.S. NN

the DT

No DT

A DT

His DT

The DT
three NN

Mr. NNP
Allen NNP
quickly RB

again RB

which WDT
somehow DT
elevated VBG
the DT

concept NN

the DT

so DT
large JJ
that IN
Mr. NNP

It EX

Yet NN
it PRP

Beginning NN

with IN
U.S. NN
v. IN
Hudson NNP

Goodwin NNP

the DT

repeatedly RB

For IN

although IN

it PRP

statutorily IN

In IN
1983 NNP

the DT
Supreme NNP

tried VBD
to TO
supply VB
a DT
workable JJ

in IN
the DT

which WDT

Consider ``

Prior NN

Mr. DT

The DT

A DT

Essentially NN

Mr. DT

The DT

Yet NN

all DT

It EX

my PRP$
contention NN

Arguably NN

But DT
even NN

reasons NNS
still RB
exist VBN

After-the-fact DT
judicial JJ
examination NN

always RB

the DT

When ``

this DT

the DT

Still NN

vulnerable VBN

the DT

When ``

so DT

In IN

For IN

The DT
three JJ

Mr. NN

quickly NN

which WDT
somehow MD

Mr. NNP

It EX

Yet UH
it ,

Beginning NN

with IN
U.S. NNP

the DT

hence DT

while IN

the DT

In IN

developed VB

For IN

although IN
insider PRP$

long VB

criminal NN

it WDT
has MD
never VB

statutorily NN

In IN
1983 NN

the DT
Supreme NNP

tried VBG
to TO
supply VB
a DT
workable JJ
definition NN
in IN
the DT
Dirks NN

which WDT

that VB

Gradually UH

however RB

Consider ``
the DT
facts NN

the DT
1989 NN
conviction NN
of IN
Robert NNP

Prior VBG
to TO
a DT

Mr. DT

Basically UH

Mr. NNP

a DT

Did ``

The DT

awfully VB
thin NN
for IN

A NN
second NN

supplied VBN
by IN
the DT
recent JJ
guilty JJ

Robert NNP
Freeman NNP

Essentially UH
, ,
Mr. NNP
Freeman NNP
had VBD
invested DT
heavily NN
in IN
the DT
Beatrice NN

when WRB
he PRP

`` ``

After ``

Mr. NNP

Mr. NNP

on IN

that IN

Lasker DT

responded VBD

`` NN

The DT
illegal JJ
`` NN

of IN
the DT

was VBD
then DT
largely RB
a DT
confirmation NN

Had ``

Did ``
Mr. DT

Finally UH
, ,
was VBD
the DT
information NN
material NN

Yet UH
, ,
all DT
these JJ
issues NNS
are VBP
subsidiary NN
to MD
a VB
more DT
central JJ
issue NN
: DT
Who NN
is VBZ
and CC
who WP
should MD
be VB
making DT
the JJ

It EX
is MD
not VB
my PRP$
contention NN
that IN
either DT
Mr. NNP
Chestman NNP
or CC
Mr. DT
Freeman NN
was VBD
an DT
innocent JJ
victim NN

prosecutorial PRP$
overzealousness NN

Arguably UH
, ,
both DT

on IN
notice NN
that IN
their PRP$

was MD
at VB

risky JJ

But ``
even DT
if IN
they PRP
behaved MD

reasons NN
still MD
exist VB
to DT
fear NN

resist VB
this DT
steady JJ
process NN
of IN
case-by-case PRP$
judicial NN
extension NN
of IN
the DT

of IN

Courts NN

in IN
very DT
different JJ
ways NN

are VBP
each DT
susceptible VBG
to TO
very VB
different DT
kinds JJS
of IN
errors NNP

After-the-fact NN
judicial NN
examination NN
of IN
an DT
actor NN
's MD
conduct VB
has DT
always MD
been VB
the DT
common JJ
law NN

method NN

When ``
only DT

, ,
this DT
method NN
has VBZ
the DT
undeniable JJ
strengths NN
of IN
factual JJ
specificity NN
and CC
avoidance NN
of IN
overgeneralization DT
. NN

Still UH
, ,
case-by-case PRP$
retrospective NN
decision NN
making NN
of IN
this DT
sort NN
is VBZ
vulnerable VBG
to TO
the DT
tunnel NN
vision NN
caused NN
by IN
a DT
fixation NN
on IN

-LRB- NNP
and CC
usually DT
sleazy NN

examples NN

When ``
a DT

decides MD
that VB
a DT

actor NN

conduct VB
was DT
culpable NN
and CC
so DT
extends VBG
the DT

to MD

this DT

, ,
it WDT
does MD
not VB
see VB
the DT
potentially JJ
enormous JJ
number NN
of IN
other JJ

that WDT

be VB
covered DT
by IN
the DT

Thus UH

a DT

is VBZ
poorly JJ
positioned NN
to MD
make VB
judgments NN
about IN
the DT
social JJ
utility NN
of IN
the DT

For IN

in IN

Mr. NNP
Freeman NNP

about IN

Can ``

to MD
make VB
certain DT
that IN

In IN

only VB

Today UH

after IN
Mr. NNP
Freeman NNP

there RB

an DT
uncertainty NN
that NN

both DT

In IN
this DT
light NN
, ,
the DT
comparative NN
advantages NN

become MD
clear VB
: DT
-LRB- NNP

Before IN

hear VB

Although IN

At IN

The DT

In IN
1987 NN

the DT

Yet UH
